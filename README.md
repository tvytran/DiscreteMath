### Assignment 1: Python Introduction and Fibonacci
Fundamental Python programming basics with a focus on string manipulation and Fibonacci algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- **Vowel Counting**: Functions to count vowels in strings, including a special "sometimes y" rule
- **Sentence Analysis**: Analysis of vowel distribution in sentences
- **Secret Code**: Functions for creating and decoding secret alphabet mappings
- **Fibonacci Implementations**: Both recursive (with memoization) and iterative approaches

**Key Files:**
- `coding1.py` - Main Python file with implemented functions
- [README for Assignment 1](./Assignment1/README.md)

Implementation of propositional logic evaluation and formatting systems.

**Key Features:**
- **Proposition Formatting**: Convert nested list representations of logical propositions to readable string format
- **Proposition Evaluation**: Evaluate logical propositions with different truth value assignments
- **Logical Operators**: Implementation of NOT, AND, OR, IF (implies), IFF (if and only if), and XOR

**Key Files:**
- `coding2.py` - Main Python file with implemented functions
- [README for Assignment 2](./Assignment2/README.md)

### Assignment 3: Functions and Relations
Exploration of mathematical functions and relations, with implementations to verify their properties.

**Key Features:**
- **Function Properties**: 
  - One-to-one (injective) verification
  - Onto (surjective) verification
  - Bijective verification
- **Relation Properties**:
  - Reflexive, symmetric, and transitive checks
  - Antisymmetric and irreflexive verification
  - Matrix representation of relations

- `coding3.py` - Main Python file with implemented functions
- [README for Assignment 3](./Assignment3/README.md)

### Assignment 4: Number Theory
Implementation of fundamental number theory algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- **Euclid's Algorithm**: Finding greatest common divisor (GCD) with step-by-step tracking
- **Prime Number Generation**: Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation for prime generation
- **Goldbach's Conjecture**: Verification that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes

**Key Files:**
- `coding4.py` - Main Python file with implemented functions
- [README for Assignment 4](./Assignment4/README.md)

## Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - Standard libraries (itertools, collections)
  - No external dependencies required

## Running the Assignments
Each assignment can be run independently using Python:

```bash
python coding1.py
python coding2.py
python coding3.py
python coding4.py
```

The output will display test cases and results for each implemented function.

## Learning Outcomes
Through these assignments, the following concepts were applied:
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developing efficient algorithms for mathematical problems
- **Discrete Structures**: Working with sets, relations, functions, and graphs
- **Logic**: Implementing propositional logic evaluation 
- **Number Theory**: Applying concepts like GCD calculation and prime number properties
- **Proof Techniques**: Verification of mathematical principles through code
